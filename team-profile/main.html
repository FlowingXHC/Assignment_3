    <h2>Haochuan XIE</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            I am Haochuan XIE and I am a member of team lucky, my student number is s3939794 and my student email address is s3939794@student.rmit.edu.au, I came from China and Chinese is my first language. I am a student of Bachelor of Information Technology. I have many outdoor hobbies, and I loves photography.<br />
            My interest in IT is about coding, and it start in year 9, I got my first laptop in that year, I have spent a lot of time with it. So, when that laptop got some bugs, I need to fix them, as my skill got better which can let me fix the problem, my interest in IT also getting stronger.<br />
            I expect to learn about coding and internet security because I thinks in this era of data, learning coding and the internet is like swordsmanship for a ranger back in that time. There are many jobs and even everywhere need to know coding and the internet.<br />


            In my opinion, we went roughly well in Assignment 2, however we do have some issues back then, such as our meeting time is kind of messy and the plan of that Assignment has not been set up very well. I have introduced some changes in order to let Assignment 3 be better that the last one, firstly, I have sated a fixed meeting time in our first meeting, and the time is decided after all members’ dissection, and made a perfectly outcome which people in our group all come on time and there are no more forgottenness or sudden meetings. Secondly I have done many talking stuff with our team numbers, and when I am sending some missions, I chose to use a more friendly and kind tone, When I am giving out the tasks, I used a strategy of asking them for their opinion instead of require them to do anything, so in general I made more discussions with my team, focused on how do they think and how do they feel of it, which helps a lot, my teammates start to change their opinions, form shy or don’t want to talk become they actually want to say something and they want to share their opinion, their idea to the group. I think those two are the best changes that I made as the leader of the team, and I have made some other changes such as giving them advice, talk to teammates to switch ideas, I can feel a huge echo in the group through those changes, and their respect is my pleasure, and the acceptation of my leading.<br />

            In our team Lucky, my ideal job is about Cybersecurity, Yibo’s ideal job is also Cybersecurity, Huijoon’s ideal job is Software engineering and Haohao’s ideal job is Solutions architect. Therefore, me and Yibo are very similar, the common element I got with Haohao is we all required to know the most common operating system, which is Windows, Mac OS and Linux. For Huijoon, our common elements are we all need to know the main program language, such as Python, Java, C++ and so on. The differentiates between me and Yibo is she need a certificate for her ideal job, but I don’t need to, and mine with Haohao is his ideal job is more about design and planning, and mine is about doing the work, my ideal job compares with Huijoon is more different, he is developing the software, and I will defend it. Overall, I think most of us are different across the group, especially for Huijoon and Haohao, but I am sure we all have a bright future. Base on my test outcomes, The online learning style test gives me my result as a visual learner, I am happy with this result because this is what I thought too, I like to watch stuff and do them step-by-step by my-self, and I think that will also help a lot when I am doing the cybersecurity job, this strength will let me find the weakness more easily so we can fix if or improve it very early on. The Myers-Briggs test gives me a result of Protagonist, in recent years, I thinks I did play the role of a protagonist, I had hosted some parties between friends and lead some groups in the class to do a project, when I am doing my work, I think I can lead a team as well and I will be protecting the things as a united group, it will be way more powerful than a few good men. In the big five personality test, the result shows I am a kind person and I prefer to work with others, I agree with that result, when I doing my work, I will be kind to people, in my opinion, if I am good to people, them they will not too bad at me, and most of the time they will be very nice at me too, so I think that strength will help we when I am leading my own team.<br />

    <h2>Huijoon Jang</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            I am Huijoon Jang from South Korea who belongs to the lucky group and is studying in Rmit. My email is s3837330@student.rmit.edu.au. It has been more than 3 years since I came to Australia.I like to play tennis as a hobby. I also like to watch tennis games. So, I watch the Australian Open every year. I decided to pursue my career in IT since I was a middle school student. At that time, I learned coding by chance, and I was very interested in myself as a middle school student. Also, I decided to enter RMIT because I wanted to learn English. Now I want to learn not only programming but also machine learning, AI and software.<br/>

            I did cloud, service, server, and IT work among IT technologies in assignment 2. There was a time when I couldn't participate in the meeting because I had to work on the weekend. In assignment 3, I will participate in the meeting as actively as possible. In Assignment 3, I will do the Aim + Roles + Testing part. I will write after reading our project carefully again.<br />

            Career Plans<br />
            My ideal job is a software engineer. But I found out that I needed more knowledge and certificate than I thought. Our team members have different ideal jobs. Examples include Field engineer, Cybersecurity, and Solutions architect. Most commonalities are that a bachelor's degree or higher is required. Also, the ability to communicate with people is important. The difference is that each learning computer language, mainly learning fields, is different.<br />

    <h2>Yibo Ding</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            My name is Yibo Ding, who is study in Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My student number is s3885516 and my student email address is s3885516@student.rmit.edu.au. I’m major in Information Technology currently. I also studied Foundation in Australia and just graduated last year. As I come from China, I can speak Chinese and English. I have two joys in my life —— basketball and music. Whenever I have time, I spend it on these two hobbies. Playing basketball is not only good for my physical health but also let me make friends. Through this sport, I learned how to work with others and realized the significance of teamwork. I also enjoy the feeling that music brings to me. With the help of music, I can keep the chaos from the surrounding world away and see my deep inner clearly.<br/>
            I have set Information Technology as the direction of my future career since high school. I had my high school in China, at that moment, I got an opportunity to learn about some basic knowledge of Information Technology. I was so excited about this wonderful technology that can bring conventions to human life in an amazing way. Since that, I became interested in it.<br />

            The results provide a scientistic conclusion to me. According to the results, I got a new and clearer understanding of myself. Now, I’m clear about what’s my personality advantages and disadvantages. Based on that information, I could develop my future direction to gain benefit and improve my weaknesses.<br />
            The test of personalities type shows I am an INFP which also knows as the Healer group. I symbol for Introversion, N for intuition, F for Feeling and P for Perceiving. Being an introversion means that I’m willing to stay alone rather than spend my time with others. As I can’t gain energy from the social activities, I think I will drop some unnecessary social activities for saving me energy. Although I have been classified to intuition, the result shows that I’m a bit of both Sensor and Intuitive. So, I’m usually using both styles and have able to switch from one to another depends on the demands in the environment I’m in when I am processing information. I believe it’s an advantage in my personality. The test classified me as “F” (Feeling) which means I’m a sensitive person. But the result also said that I’m neither an absolute thinker nor a feeler type. So, I’m neither totally on my logical nor emotion when I need to make decisions. The last symbol of my personality is “P”, because I like to keep things casual and open-ended. I think this personality explains why I like to change my decisions at the last-minute and it might be the weakness for me. Based on this result, I would tend to turn myself more scheduled and organized in the future.<br />
            The other test shows that my learning type is visual. It explains that I can gain knowledge better when I read or see pictures. In this point, I am going to change my current learning method to be more visually oriented in order to improve my learning efficiency.<br />
            For the last test, I have been classified as a romantic person who trade job and behavior as the way to express my inner self. Under those tests’ help, I see myself clearer and have some specific directions to change myself.<br />
            Overall, the tests indicate that I have great skill in processing information and making decisions and those skills are important for any teamwork. And I’m good at analytic of visual resources which can be helpful in a team. Also, I’m kind of person who has imagination and creativity and always has the unique ways to bringing meaning and determination to myself and people around me.<br />

            About our group processes:<br />
            I think in a2 when working with team members, it was very nice to everyone into a group, when we meet meeting, everybody is very rusty, also dare not speak may because is a stranger, because I don't have the team cooperation, at the same time also is a very shy shy person, so see you don't talk, I don't talk, I didn't timely discuss and communicate with others about things I didn't quite understand. Besides, something happened to my computer in a2 stage. At first, the microphone couldn't hear, and then the camera went black. We each week meeting time is not fixed, sometimes suddenly received news meeting unprepared, this leads to several times and participate in the meeting is not stable, everybody discussion is focusing to do their own part, discussion time is less, most of the time, only the team leader in speech, until finally we finish time is tight, there wasn't enough time to make the changes. In a3 is different, this is no fault about computers, basic can open voice and video cameras, also let go of a lot of discussion, I will also take an active part in our discussion, don't understand myself and what I understand all say out, have self-judgment and opinion, has become a strong-minded man, the assignment of the also know a lot of. The team leader has set up two meetings every week. Every time team members are reminded by email; they will enter our meetings in time. This is the biggest progress. At the same time, the efficiency is also high, everyone clearly understands their own division of labor, the progress is also very fast. In general, it seems to me that people are clearly doing better on the A3 project than on the A2 more like a cooperative team.<br />

            My ideal job is network security administrator. Why I choose that because I think it's great to have someone in charge of security, especially on the internet, who makes me feel justified!<br />
            The work of our team members is related to each other. For example, the work of Haochuan and I is related to security. Huijoon wants to be a software engineer, while Haohao wants to be a solution architect. Huijoon can develop his own favorite software, and Haochuan and I can escort his software, and we have absolute control in security. Everyone should learn to use python, SQL, other work may need to learn a little more, such as C++…<br />

            I'm INFP, also known as therapist group. I stand for introversion, N for intuition, F for feeling, and P for perception. Being an introvert means I prefer to be alone rather than spend time with other people. Since I can't get energy from social activities, I think I will give up some unnecessary social activities to save energy. Although I'm classed as intuitive, it turns out I'm a bit sensitive and intuitive. So, I usually use both styles and can switch from one to the other, depending on the needs of the environment in which I'm processing the information. I believe this is a strength in my character.<br />

            So, I was sensitive to what others said, and I was not good at communicating with people. I was a little bit of social phobia and afraid of social contact. Sometimes I was afraid that if I did something wrong, I would become a burden or a distraction for others. When I don't understand, he comes out to help me answer difficult questions.<br />

I am not afraid to point out what is wrong in the world, and my mind is forthright and unsparing in its judgment. I value personal achievement and progress, don't expect help from anyone, and take responsibility for getting what I want in life. I value the combination of tradition and innovation. I'm usually content to do things the way the transformation works until it stops working, at which point I'm happy to use the new approach.<br />
