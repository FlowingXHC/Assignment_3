            I think we went well on the time management, we had all our meeting set up in the start of this assignment, and all members have been sent a task to do and they all submitted it on time. I think the things need to improve for us is only the knowledge we had, we need more knowledge to do our assignment better, we need both knowledge we can learn from school and maybe we should also learn things from our part time jobs, the reason I think this way is because I think our celebration is getting stronger and stronger, we can celebrate very nice now. I am surprising about our team members start to ask questions to each one, which helps us so much for this assignment. One thing That I have learned about my groups is there are no weak team members, there are only weak groups, and the strongness or weakness is most depends on the team leader, so if anyone want to be a team leader, then they need strategy. I think tools helped us a lot, for either our celebration or communications.

            In A3, the overall progress was very smooth, everyone attended the meeting on time, and there were not too many absences. We were very efficient in this project. We had not finished it completely before the deadline, but we finished it ahead of time and made many modifications, so we had plenty of time. I have also done much better in this project than before. I have learned to communicate and improved my understanding ability. At the same time, MY efficiency has also been improved and I have better understood what I should write.

            Our project went well as planned, and in this project, we needed to master how to develop an app and how to design the interface and functionality of the app. For the interface, we need to determine the UI interface of the product to ensure that our application is easy for users to use.<br />

            Our target users are the elderly, so we need to investigate the software that the elderly use most often, and identify each software with a specific color. But we also realize that learning development languages and tools is difficult, so we need to spend enough time on technology learning.<br />

            In teams, I realize that group strength helps us accomplish something that is difficult for us to do alone. From an idea, we found our team's central purpose, and the process of everyone working on it was a great experience.<br />

            By recording the progress of our group's tasks on github, we can record the trajectory of our learning, and expand our technical capabilities through continuous learning, allowing us to make continuous progress.<br />
