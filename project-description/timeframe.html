        <h3>Week 5:</h3>
        <p>
            In this week, we had our first meeting. We read several parts of our project work together, understood and discussed each part in detail, and made an appointment for the next meeting.In this week, we reviewed the last meeting, skimmed the PDF of the project and divided the group members.<br />

            <br />

            Haochuan Xie will do plans+communications.<br />

            Because this general plan is Haochuan's idea from the beginning, so Haochuan will continue to do plans+communications.<br />



            <br />



            Yibo Ding will do Time-frame+risks.<br />

            Because Yibo is careful and good at Time planning, so she chooses timeframe +Risks<br />

            <br />

            Huijoon Jang will do Aim+roles+Testing<br />

            Because Huijoon likes discovery and is good at testing, so he chose Aim+roles+Testing.<br />

            <br />

            Haohao Xing will do Tools+limits<br />

            Because，for android, Haohao said that it is based on C++, and he is good at C++, so he chose  Tools+limits.

        <h3>Week 6:</h3>
        <p>
            In this week，our plan has been finished; we are now ready to start the development of the software.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="para">
        <h3>Week 7:</h3>
        <p>
            This is our first week of software development, and our goal this week is to do a first step plan. Firstly, we will make an overview of software development. Everyone will say what they are good at and then divide the work. Requirement analysis is divided into three parts: requirement analysis, prototype design and UI design.
        </p>

        <h3>Week 8:</h3>
        <p>
            The goal this week is to do a division of labor and needs analysis.<br />

            Yibo should first write a specific development plan and conduct demand analysis at the same time. She is careful and good at finding details, which is beneficial to analysis and avoids omission.<br />

            Haochuan is engaged in prototype design, because the initial idea of this project was brought up by him. It is easy for him to integrate his own ideas into the prototype design.<br />

            Haohao and Huijoon design UI together, through the ideas of four team members to come up with a design style that everyone likes. Haohao is quite proficient in C++ and Python, which will be of great help in the code programming part of UI design. Huijoon is good at HTML and CSS, so this is an essential skill in UI design.<br />

        <h3>Week 9:</h3>
        <p>
            Our goal this week is to design a system based on the requirement analysis completed last time. Next, we divide the system design into three parts, namely, structure design, detailed design and database design. All parts need to be carefully avoided this week.<br />

            The structural design of the system is divided into four parts: systematicness, flexibility, reliability and economy.<br />

            Haochuan will carry out systematic and flexible design and try his best to unify the data. Because he is good at Python, he can write more unified code. He is flexible in terms of flexibility and familiar with the template structure, so he is responsible for these two parts.<br />

            Huijoon is responsible for the design of reliability and economy. His dream is to become a software engineer. Security confidentiality, error detection and error correction are very important in this work, so he wants to take a challenge in this project. He was also interested in keeping the overhead of the system as low as possible while meeting the requirements of the system and that's why he was responsible for those two parts.<br />

            Haohao will be responsible for database design, he is familiar with SQL related software, also can construct an optimal database mode, establish database and other application mode in a certain environment.<br />
        </p>

    <div class="para">
        <h3>Week 10:</h3>
        <p>
            Our goal this week is to develop the system, which is divided into four parts in detail: software development specification, software coding, unit testing, and customer trial.<br />

            Haohao will be responsible for developing the specification side, he can turn the more complex into simpler, standardize the project directory structure and standardize the code.<br />

            Haochuan will carry out the software coding part, it needs to be careful when writing software code, it is a very detailed person who loves research, it may be a good decision to give it.<br />

            There are many different methods used in unit testing. Through searching, we found that there are four basic methods, manual static analysis, automatic static analysis, automatic dynamic testing and manual dynamic testing. After a unanimous decision, we chose manual static analysis.<br />

            Huijoon oversaw this part and searched for errors through manual reading of the code. After his test, the other three members would check each other's code alternately, because characteristic errors and no characteristic errors might be found in this way.<br />

            Finally, Yibo will share the test with customers for trial, to see if there is anything that the customers are very dissatisfied with or whether the trial will fail.<br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="gap"></div>
    <div class="para">
        <h3>Week 11:</h3>
        <p>
            Integration testing is our goal this week. Be careful before you accept the system. Integration testing is the first step. Integration testing is divided into three parts, test plan, test case, and test execution. This week starts with test plan and test case. The test plan and test cases will take place this week, and test execution will take place next week.<br />

            Haochuan designed modules by himself on Week9, so the understanding and programming logic may be inconsistent with other team members.<br />

            Huijoon needs to cooperate with Haochuan to verify software modules and achieve unified work this week.<br />

            Yibo looks for the first test case. She looks for examples of interaction tests, such as receiving messages on the phone, listening to music while browsing new texts...<br />

            Haohao wants to find a second test case. He is looking for things like making a call when memory is full, making a call when database is full...<br />
        </p>

    <div class="para">
        <h3>Week 12:</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this week is to conduct test execution, in order to test the effectiveness of the software function, by simulating the environment to verify that the software performance meets the user's expectations. This stage is divided into three parts, function test, performance test and security test.<br />

            Huijoon will conduct the functional test, because he knows how to test whether the function is normal and can meet the expectation.<br />

            Haohao will conduct performance test, load test and software stress test. He thinks he is qualified for this part, so he chooses to conduct performance test.<br />

            Yibo and Haochuan will carry out security tests, such as whether there will be privacy leakage, whether it can resist viruses, specified content crawling... The reason why these two team members chose the security test is that the positions they want to be qualified for in the future are all related to security, so the security test is assigned to them. At the same time, they can help each other to check whether there are any omissions in the security test.<br />

            Huijoon has done a lot of testing, so he will write the summary report of testing.<br />

            Yibo does a lot of analysis, so she writes the summary report of analysis.<br />

            Haochuan is doing a lot of research on design, so he writes the summary report on design.<br />

            Haohao is doing a lot of coding, so he comes to give the summary report of coding.<br />

            After writing, make the first revision.<br />
