            In software development we will encounter a variety of risks and problems, even if we carefully to develop, there will be certain inevitable risks and problems. At the same time, risks can also be divided into predictable and unpredictable risks. Executable risks are known or explicit risks that can be prevented, controlled and eliminated through pre-formulated solutions. Unpredictable risk means that unexpected situations cannot be controlled during software development, so risk prediction is also very important in software development.

        <h2>Quality risk: </h2>
        <p>
            functional standards, development standards and quality technology standards may lead to software failure to meet the expected standards. After all, no one can achieve 100% perfection, and some small errors may cause quality risks.

        <h2>Organizational risk: </h2>
        <p>
            In understanding the standards and scope of the project, everyone has different funds, which can easily lead to risks.

        <h2>Technical risk: </h2>
        <p>
            potential problems in verification, interface, maintenance, implementation and design. There are technical gaps and unknown areas, which bring great risks to software development.

        <p>
            customers may exert pressure on us, which will also lead to our efficiency progress and ability. Such risks are obviously uncontrollable. For example, the client originally said to complete the development of the project within one year, and our plan was fully divided within one year. However, the client suddenly said to complete the development within half a year, which means that we will be overturn all the plans for this year and urgently set up a more compact plan.

    <div class="para">
        <h2>Personnel risk:</h2>
        <p>
            Lack of professional knowledge, misunderstanding of knowledge leads to part of content being wrong, which may also cause danger. Secondly, there is a large turnover of staff, and different people will modify the template at the beginning into another form, which will also cause a lot of uncertainties in the content of this part, and I don't know which version should be used.
