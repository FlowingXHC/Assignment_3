            We have made a timetable for our team meeting time, which we will be meet every Thursday and Sunday at 4:30pm, this makes our communication very convenient, about how will our team communicate, we defiantly cannot make a face-to-face meeting happened, so we used teams for the announcement, which we will be publish important news and things in teams and we will talk about it, also as we made a time table, we will meet twice a week plus on the meeting time in Monday’s class. We have also talk to each other by either email or WeChat, by those, we have almost communicated to each other every day, if we have a new idea or something, we will be talk to our team members, which is very good and bring us many interesting ideas. For members that don’t respond to me, what I will do is just wait for a day if it is not that important information that I want to talk about, and if it is a very important information, then I will be sending more email or text and even changes the place to send text, such as I will be sending messages by both email and teams. For those people that don’t even respond to others, I think I will try to talk to the person first, to have a chat, get to know what is going on, is there anything that need our help, because we are a team, and if that person still don’t want to communicate to us, then I think I will be telling this to my teacher and have a discuss about what should we do next, but we don’t have that kind of person in our team, we all acting very fast and finished our job quickly and nicely.
