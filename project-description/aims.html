            Do the elderly understand WeChat or messenger applications on the market easily and easily and use all the functions of the application?<br />

            Our ultimate goal is to make it easier for the elderly to contact their acquaintances and people around them through this app. If you look at WeChat and other video call applications on the market, the elderly is more confused and don't know how to get out because there are many advertising and junk messages. And most applications try to meet their goals by using small-sized handwriting to put as much information as possible on a small screen. However, our goal is to make them use the app conveniently by using large bold font because it is their easy video call and messenger use. Our ultimate goal is to differentiate ourselves from other applications so that they can easily find and easily call their acquaintances' numbers. Therefore, the most important part of the application is convenience and good readability. It is easy for them to use the application, and whether they can understand the functions and information we put into designing the application comfortably is the most important goal of this application.<br />
