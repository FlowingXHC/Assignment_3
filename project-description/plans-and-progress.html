    <h2>Overview: </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            We are planning to develop a smartphone APP called “Grandpa’s App”, “Grandpa’s APP” will mix many shortcuts of other apps, it will allow putting their common app in, and it will help people to do their regular job of each day, such as clock in or receive other apps rewards. It is mainly designed for the elder, to optimize their experience of using a smartphone or let them able to use a smartphone, therefore, the “Grandpa’s APP” will be using large font and a colourful graphical interface, which allow them to remember each APP’s colour if they still can’t see. Also, we are planning to use multiple pages ordered by capital letter or custom instead of scroll page, in case people don’t know where they are at, the easier the best, we will design this APP in their most familiar way.

    <h2>Story of our project </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            The motivation of design “Grandpa's APP” is come from Haochuan, as soon as he moved to Australia, his grandparents start to learn how to use WeChat and how to use video call, his grandmother can learn that easily, but his grandfather cannot see very much because of presbyopia, so he can’t call Haochuan at any time he wants and he needs to ask Haochuan’s grandmother for help, which makes that not so convenient. And both can’t use message very well, because there are many advertisings messages and junk messages, they cannot easily recognize which message is useful to add on the classification of message is not that clear, so they always made some mistake on that. Those are the two main motivations for us to design this APP. We are sure that there will be many elder people who need this APP.<br />



            “Grandpa’s APP” is designed for the elders, so it will be very easy to use, a colourful graphical interface will be contained, let people be able to remember the colour of icons even they cannot see the word on it, I will be also using large font word so that people can easily read. The operating mode of this APP will be very simple and straight forward, It will be designed step by step, as the image shows, for example, If people want to use WeChat’s video call to call someone, then they will click on WeChat first, then a list of name will appeal, after people find the person they want to call, two huge options will appear in front of them, they can do either video call or phone call by WeChat, The operating mode is similar with WeChat, but what we planned is to let user decide and user will have all the power in this APP, once they have putted someone in the first place at the first page, that name will remain there, it won’t change by a single new message from others, then user won’t need to find that person in a group of people, even user only have a small social circle with a few connections, they still need to find for that people, what I will do is to minimize those things might confuse users, to have a better and familiar experience, just like at the old days using the telephone directory, Haochuan saw his grandfather can find the number he wants in telephone directory within a few second, but he cannot even find the name of that person in WeChat, so our goal is to design an APP that they will be comfortable to use. We are planning to use multiple pages ordered by capital letter or custom instead of scroll page, in case people don’t know where are they at, the easier the best, or we will just use numbers to order them, we will also do more search on that, to see which type they prefer, we will also add a huge “Back” button, we saw they have always wondered how to get back when they are using other APPs, we won’t contain a single gestures operation, all they need to do is click on the big button, this should make the experience much better. For messages, we will use the same design as the WeChat page, but that part won’t appear all the messages come to the phone, we will give them an option to set the numbers they want to receive, so they can only receive the important message in the “easy use”, they can put such as family number/bank message/friends number in so they will only see those message, and when family numbers that can use a smartphone come to them, they can check the rest of the messages for them.<br />



            We have already created the UI design by Figma, which is a very important part of our project. We have also start to be planning for what are we going to do for the further development.<br />

            We have made some changes and decisions to make this APP more pluralism, we will be including more language, more compatible applications or even more home page types. On the other hand, we have also considered about to make two main kind of the home page, one is for elder people, they need huge buttons, large font size or even colorful buttons, the another one will be minimalism style, which is a style that I am very prefer, and this kind is design for the younger communities, because we cannot find so many this kind of applications in the app store, so we decide if we made this application, why don’t we make the best use of it, to give all people a chance to use it in their familiar way, also, if both younger people and old people use the same App, they will be all familiar with this App and it is more easy for younger people to teach elder people how to use it, and that might even bring a topic between those two generations, get their relationship closer an get rid of the generation gap.<br />

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            If the project is successful, then our grandfather can call us with WeChat video call very easily, both of Haochuan’s grandparents can read the important message easily, and after they can read the messages, especially bank messages, then they won’t need to walk to bank constantly, they will know what happened wailed they stay at home and looking at their smartphones. The original problem will be solved, and elders can feel the convenience of this new age.

    <h2>Handle to new team </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            If I need to hand this project to a new group to complete, I think I will firstly need to give them a brief understanding of the aim and outcome that we are expecting to achieve after the project is completed, I think even if they will decide to change the goal, but they will still need to get know what is the initial ideal of this project. Secondly, I will be hand over the list of tools we have used to develop it and every step and the annotation of each step. Therefore, we will be including those major steps in our final report.<br />



            I think for those people to talking over this project, the things they need to know will be very similar as those things that I will be handling to them.
