            Since we are using Python, Java, Photoshop, and Android development app when we design this App, we need to run the program after finishing up the project. When the programs run without any problems, we will know that we have succeeded in designing this App.<br />

            So, we will perform application testing in two ways: manual testing and automated testing. The manual testing approach is used more frequently by developers in the early stages of development to test certain functionalities. And the automated testing approach is used to test scenarios from the perspective of end-users to evaluate the application's usability, functionality, and performance once it has been fully completed. Because they are designed to tackle specific real-world issues, each application has its own set of features and standards. Application testing guarantees that the produced app is stable and satisfies the needs of its users. First, we'll devise a test strategy based on the application's needs. Then, from the standpoint of the end-users, we'll create manual test case scenarios. The test scenarios will then be automated using scripts. Finally, we'll run functional tests to ensure that everything is working as it should.<br />

            In order to test the App, we are going to test this application against at least 500 elderly people, and because the ability and understanding of the application may vary depending on the culture, we are going to test it against elderly people from various countries and races. By doing so, I think we can derive more diverse data and accurate results.<br />
